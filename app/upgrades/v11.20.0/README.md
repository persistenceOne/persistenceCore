v11.20.0 was not a software-proposal upgrade.
It was an upgrade for security fix -> https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v and https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg

AppName is still v11.17.0 for this one, and AppName v11.20.0 will be omitted as this release will be tagged 11.20.0 because it is an API breaking fix.
