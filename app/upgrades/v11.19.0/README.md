v11.19.0 was not a software-proposal upgrade.
It was an upgrade for security fix -> https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw

AppName is still v11.17.0 for this one, and AppName v11.19.0 will be omitted as this release will be tagged 11.19.0 because it is an API breaking fix.
